Clinical Management System
Introduction 
Clinical Management System is an organized computerized system designed and programmed to deal with day to day operations and management of the hospital activities. The program can look after inpatients, outpatients, records, database treatments, status illness, billings in the pharmacy and labs. It also maintains hospital information such as doctor name, doctors in charge and department administering. The major problem for the patient nowadays to get report after consultation , many hospital managing reports in their system but it's not available to the patient when he / she is outside. In this project we are going to provide the extra facility to store their data into encryption form in the database and make available from anywhere in the world the clinical Hospital Management system includes registration of doctor and patients, storing their details into the system. The Management System can be entered using a username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. Only they can add data into the database. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast. Hospital Management System is powerful, flexible, and easy to use and is designed and developed to deliver real conceivable benefits to hospitals. It is an integrated end-to- end Hospital Management System that provides relevant information across the hospital to support effective decision making for patient care, hospital administration

Goals
* User friendly
* Simple fast
* Low cost and effective
* it deals with the collection of patientâ€™s information
* Diagnosis

Objective
*Define hospital
*recording information about the Patients that come. 
*Keeping record of the Immunization provided to children/patients

MODULES: 

Admin module
engage department of hospitals, user, doctor, nurse, pharmacist, laboratories. Watch appointment of doctors. Watch operation report




SYSTEM DESIGN: 
INTRODUCTION TO UML: 
UML Design
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language for
specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the software system and its
components. It is a graphical language, which provides a vocabulary and set of
semantics and rules. The UML focuses on the conceptual and physical representation of
the system. It captures the decisions and understandings about systems that must be
constructed. It is used to understand, design, configure, maintain, and control
information about the systems.

The UML is a language for:
1.Visualizing
2.Specifying
3.Constructing
4.Documenting

1. Visualizing
Through UML we see or visualize an existing system and ultimately we visualize how the system is going to be after implementation. Unless we think, we cannot implement. UML helps to visualize, how the components of the system communicate and interact with each other.
2. Specifying
Specifying means building, models that are precise, unambiguous and complete
UML addresses the specification of all the important analysis design, implementation decisions that must be made in developing and deploying a software system
3. Constructing
UML models can be directly connected to a variety of programming language through mapping a model from UML to a programming language like python or C++. Forward Engineering and Reverse Engineering is possible through UML.
4. Documenting
The Deliverables of a project apart from coding are some Artifacts, which are critical in controlling, measuring and communicating about a system during its developing requirements, architecture, desire, source code, project plans, tests, prototypes releasers, etc.
